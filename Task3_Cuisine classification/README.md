# Task 3: Cuisine Classification

## Objective
Develop a machine learning model to classify restaurants based on their cuisine type using restaurant features.

## Dataset
Zomato restaurant dataset containing attributes such as votes, approximate cost for two people, online ordering availability, table booking, location, and cuisine type.

## Steps Performed
- Data preprocessing and handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Train-test split of the dataset
- Training a Logistic Regression classification model
- Model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Analysis of model performance and bias across different cuisines

## Results
The classification model achieved an accuracy of approximately 27%. It was observed that cuisines such as North Indian and South Indian are often confused due to similar restaurant characteristics, while cuisines like Italian and Continental are predicted more accurately.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Zomato Restaurant Dataset.
